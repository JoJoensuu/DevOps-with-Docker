# DevOps-with-Docker

* [1.15 homework](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/joensjon/cybersecurity-project/general)

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Docker installed on your system. For installation instructions, see https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

## Pulling and running the image

### `docker pull joensjon/cybersecurity-project:latest`

### `docker run -p 8000:8000 -it joensjon/cybersecurity-project:latest`

## 3.2
* [3.2](https://github.com/HelsinkiUniCollab/WeatherBasedRecommender)

Did not do 1.16 so our OHTU-project repository will have to do. It gets deployed to cloud upon every successful pull-request to main branch.
